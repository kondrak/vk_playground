# Vulkan playground
My personal SDL2 stub project with 6DOF WASD camera for Vulkan experiments. Targetted at VS2015 development. Basic math functionality and simple debug overlay (FPS counter) included.

This is a download-and-get-running-asap type of a project for your quick development pleasure.

Building on MacOS
-----
The XCode project requires some additional steps:
- set the VULKAN_SDK environment variable pointing to downloaded Vulkan SDK location
- download and install SDL 2.0.8 (or higher) framework
